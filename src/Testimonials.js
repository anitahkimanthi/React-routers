            <p>I have used eLimu to do practice exams and revision. I scored 390 in my mocks.
                 I want all kids to be able to do this because it is very easy and you don't struggle a lot.
                  It's the best way to prepare for national exams. 
                I dream that someday the schools will be more interesting and we can eLimu content to learn.</p>

                <p>My students love pictures and diagrams, learning how to make a photo story was my best lesson.
                     Choosing relevant images, taking pictures and creating a well organized lesson was really interesting.
                     Also being able to cut parts of a video and choosing just the parts my students want.</p>
